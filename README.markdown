## Overview

The dotcms module installs and manages [dotCMS](https://dotcms.com/) with Puppet.

[dotCMS](https://dotcms.com/) is a scalable, Java-based, open source content management system (CMS) that has been designed to manage and deliver personalized, permission based content experiences across multiple channels. dotCMS can serve as the plaform for sites, mobile apps, mini-sites, portals, intranets or as a headless CMS (content is consumed via RESTful APIs).

## Setup

### What dotcms affects

* dotCMS application and bundled server installation.
    * Installs application to /opt/dotcms/dotcms_x.y.z/ by default.
    * Uses dotCMS' release directory structure by default.
    * Uses the dotCMS release's bundled Tomcat instance by default.
* Manages the general application configuration plugin in /opt/dotcms/dotcms_x.y.z/plugins/com.dotcms.config/. For configuration plugin information, see [dotCMS' documentation on Changing dotCMS Configuration Properties](https://dotcms.com/docs/latest/changing-dotcms-configuration-properties).
    * Configures Tomcat HTTP connector for port 8080 by default.
* dotCMS system services.

### Beginning with dotcms

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading (For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).

## Usage

### Install and Configure the Application
In order to install and configure the application, declare the dotcms class.

```puppet
class { 'dotcms': }
```

It is recommended that you set, at a minimum, your PostgreSQL database information parameters.

```puppet
class { 'dotcms':
    postgres_username => 'my_dotcms_db_user',
    postgres_password => 'my_extremely_secure_dotcms_db_password',
}
```

For more configuration options, see the [Reference section](#reference).
